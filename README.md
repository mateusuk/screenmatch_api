  ## üíª Description
  
  The ScreenMatch project is being transformed from a command-line application into a REST API. This process involves understanding the MVC architecture and using Spring annotations for route mapping to ensure efficient client-server interaction. Best practices and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) will be implemented to maintain clean and efficient code. The API will receive movie data from the OMDB API, add it to the local database, and then transfer it to the front-end application. CORS issues will be addressed to enable secure data sharing. This integration provides a seamless fullstack experience, demonstrating the complete workflow from back-end to front-end.
